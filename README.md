## Introduction 

Set the path to the file from the data which is on line 67 in alg_slo.py
in slonie.py change line 5 
Sample files are located in the slo folder.

## Technologies

*Python 2.7.18

in alg_ele.py
*from itertools import zip_longest

# Launch

Download the project set the path to the data file and run for example in pycharm.
In in alg_ele.py zip_longest library should be imported from itertools
